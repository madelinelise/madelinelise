Hey, I'm Madeline - an Engineering Manager that likes to work with open source technologies and being the real human version of myself for those around me.

I like building things & being a people manager as well. You can check out the kinds of things I've worked on at the GitHub Pages version of my resume at https://madelinelise.github.io/resume/.
